Description: Java bindings for Thrift
 Thrift is a software framework for scalable cross-language services
 development. It combines a software stack with a code generation engine to
 build services that work efficiently and seamlessly.
 .
 This package contains the Java bindings for Thrift. You will need the thrift
 tool (in the thrift-compiler package) to compile your definition to Java
 classes, and then the modules in this package will allow you to use those
 classes in your programs.
